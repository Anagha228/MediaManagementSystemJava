Media Library

A Java-based application to manage Books, Movies, and Albums using object-oriented design and modern Java features.

Overview

This project implements a Media Library system in Java, demonstrating interfaces and abstract classes for clean, reusable design, inheritance and polymorphism with Book, Movie, and Album items, data handling and statistics such as count by type, average length, top-rated items, custom iterators and filtering to iterate over items and filter by rating, and streams and functional programming for sorting and collecting data. The library allows adding media items, querying by creator, filtering by rating, and generating summaries based on type or rating.

Features

The library allows adding books, movies, and albums. Users can retrieve all titles by a specific creator, list top titles by rating, count items by type, calculate average length for a specific type, and filter items based on a minimum rating.

Getting Started

Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/media-library.git. Compile the project using javac *.java. Run tests or demo using java MediaA3 if a main method is provided.

Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming in Java, interface and abstract class usage, Stream API for sorting and filtering, custom iterator implementation, and data aggregation and analysis.

Optional Enhancements

Possible enhancements include adding persistence to save/load the library from a file, expanding media types beyond books, movies, and albums, and integrating a simple GUI or command-line interface.
